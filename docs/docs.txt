Client To-Do List:
1. add shadow to reset button 
2. make textarea submit button look better (i.e. when they press it, it should convert into a loading circle) 
3. change textarea colour (not needed)
4. darker background (not needed)
5. add line between commands
6. make output window smaller

Server To-Do List:
1. In controller for post api return data (in columns and rows)

Future Plans:
1. Make result  
2. Creating users
3. Home page
4. Create pipelines so users can make multiple pages with commands
5. customize profile (https://github.com/react-icons/react-icons)

Open Points:
1. Server Security
2. Client and server performance
3. Use of multiple external libraries for both server and client

Done:
reduce size of texarea (done)
create mongo db model (done)
increase font of text within texarea (done)
add textarea data to mongo db (done)

Current Issues:
1. No primary key for data being sent from the client (i.e. command input)

Next steps till project resumes: 
Frontend: 
1. Create login page

Backend: 
1. Secure some routes which can be accessed only if user logged in
